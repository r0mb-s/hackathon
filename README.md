# Carflow.

> Our Journey started with the idea of a way to manage our time better. One of our problems with managing our time is the traffic we are usually stuck in.
We came with  way to help with that. With the help of our app you can check the traffic flow on the map and prevent being stuck in it with the help of our directions API
The API will guide you on the quickest route with the least traffic in order to help you get to your destination without any problems.
